				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this part of the experiment, we wanted to focus on creating a minigame centering around removing a particular tile from an infinite procedural generator. 
					The user is able to press the arrow keys to move around the landscape and hold down their mouse to remove the darkness from the land. Additionally, 
					the water changes color and bobs slowly as time passes.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To accomplish the task of creating this minigame, we used noise functions for the biome generation. Additionally, whenever a land biome is generated,
					there is a chance for a darkness patch to spawn. To implement the animation for removing the darkness, we used a lerp function to phase between the black
					color into the grass color. Finally, we used sin and cos waves in order to simulate the gentle bobbing of the water and the change in color. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I am happy with the creation of this minigame. We believe that the task of removing this darkness goes hand in hand with the general rules for this
					assignment, being the implementation of random infinite generators and user interaction. If more time was spent implementing this scene, we likely would've 
					add additional details to the biomes to make them more aesthetically pleasing.
