				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Picking from a list of four images, this program recreates the desired image using basic shapes, including rectangles, circles, and triangles. To pick an image and/or
					shape, select an option from either of the two dropdowns. The original image is shown on top, with the actively generating images below. Below the active score and 
					FPS counter, the most accurate image generated is shown along with a list of the previous best images.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To create this generator, a lot of fine-tuning went into the creatiion of the shapes through the iterative process. Overall, I believe I managed to find a good 
					middle-ground where the shapes generated cover the background while maintaining accuracy according to the original image. The active score details how close 
					the generated image is to the original, and when a new best is found the previous best is added to list of memorial images.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I am pleased with the accuracy and clarity of the images that are generated with this program. While there likely could be some improvements made to 
					the optimization of this implementation, I believe that the speed of generation is made up for by the level of detail generated by the images.
