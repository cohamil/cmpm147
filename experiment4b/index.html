				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this generator, we experimenented with tile movement in relation to the movement of water. In particular, we wanted to simulate a wave machine that
					shows water displacement over time. With the addition of randomly generated colors, we added intervals of random rippling to the tiles to ensure that 
					life is always being shown.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The primary technical side of this scene has to do with the generation of waves. Aside from assigning a random color value to every tile, the waves are
					created using variables determining wave propagation speed, dissipation rate, maximum wave distance, and maximum wave duration. Using these values, the
					waves are generating by adding displacement to the corresponding tiles. These methods are called upon in random intervals using the generateNewWave function.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>After finishing this generator, we are happy with the final product. We believe that the colors used are very appealing and the wave effect successfully 
					imitates real-life water displacement. If we were to potentially add to this generator, we could add different obstacles for the water, including rocks 
					or other objects which would add interesting interactions.
