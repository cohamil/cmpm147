					<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color: Colors are inspired by the original image, including the color of the lava, eye, tower, clouds, and general landscape.</li>
                        <li>Primitives: The clouds are rendered with the "ellipse" primitive.</li>
                        <li>Polygons: The lava is generated from a set of points using the "curvedVertex" function.</li>
                        <li>Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mountains and clouds.</li>
                        <li>Life: The position of the eye's pupil is changed relative to the mouse cursor, giving the effect that the eye is watching the cursor.</li>
                    </ul>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>With this assignment, the hardest part was getting used to using P5.js, as I didn't have any experience with it beforehand. Additionally, trying to create randomness was difficult
					because of the fact that the "draw" function is ran every frame, meaning that in the case of the clouds the positions needed to be saved in an array. This added a layer of 
					complexity to the project. Overall, I enjoyed using P5.js to create this image, and am happy with the result. If I decided to spend more time on it, I would try and work on 
					creating randomness with the streams of lava, as I believe that the position of the lava being decided by the seed would be a good touch.
